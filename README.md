# COGS118B_Final_Project
For this project I will be classifying each pixel of an image under 3 labels: "single", "co-label", and background. The motivation for this is that the activities of two neurotransmitters, glutamate and GABA, in the lateral habenula is linked to depression. Therefore, by knowing whether there are only glutamate (labeled as "single") or both (labeled as "co-label") activities in a region can aid depression research. For the classifier I'll be training three gaussian distributions using MLE. Then, to classify the images, I'll be finding the gaussian that the testing pixel has the highest probability to be in by substitution.
